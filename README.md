The code provided is the code used in the Polihack Competition v16, in which, together with my team, we created a light bulb that changes its intensity and temperature based on the light outside and on the time of the day. 
The project was made using a smart light bulb that is able to connect to wifi.
In order to connect to its wifi, we used a esp32 board and via finding the port of the wifi we connect to, we were able to send the changes to the parameters of the bulb, based on a light sensor and the time of the day.
